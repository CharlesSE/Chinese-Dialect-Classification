# Chinese-Dialect-Classification
Project for TDT4310: Classification of Mandarin text from Mainland China and Taiwan.

To run the POS tagger you need to download the Stanford Tagger (Full Version): https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml#Download

The Stanford tagger should be placed in the same folder as the rest of the code, so that the path matches path_to_model and path_to_jar. Similarly, the corpus should also be placed in this folder, so that its path matches TRAIN_PATH and TEST_PATH.
